# 👋 Hi, I’m Manjunath Shenoy 
I break things (intentionally), fix things (reluctantly), and build things (when absolutely necessary).  

Over the past **15+ years**, I’ve been called many things:  
**NOC Engineer. SRE. Kubernetes Platform Administrator. Platform Software Engineer.**  
Let’s be real—titles are mostly **random labels assigned by companies**
What actually matters? The person behind those titles and the way they approach problems. So here’s a bit about me.

### **What I Believe**
📌 **Tools don’t solve problems. People do.**  
Most tech challenges aren’t about tools at all—they’re about process. Tools only work when the people and workflows behind them do.

📌 **I don’t believe in “experts in everything.”**  
I’ve worked across many domains, but if you expect someone who’s 100% up-to-date on everything—keep looking.  

📌 **If something is breaking, slow, unreliable, or just making your life miserable—I can help.**  
I thrive on diagnosing **weird, annoying, and hard-to-trace** technical problems.

## **What I Do**
- **Incident Management & Reliability:** SRE, NOC, postmortems that actually lead to change.  
- **Observability & Debugging:** Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry, tracing, log pipelines.  
- **Infrastructure & Provisioning:** Terraform, Kubernetes, Helm, ArgoCD, GitOps.  
- **Cloud & On-Prem:** AWS, GCP, bare metal, hybrid setups.  
- **Configuration Management:** Ansible, Puppet, Salt, homegrown chaos.  
- **Internal Developer Tooling:** Built and maintained platform tooling in Go, Python, and Bash to automate infrastructure, improve deployments, and reduce cognitive load—because good tooling should make engineers’ lives easier, not harder.
- **Performance & Scale:** Load balancing, network optimization, debugging weird CPU/memory behavior.  
- **Security & Access Control:** RBAC, IAM, secrets management, Vault, SSO.  
- **CI/CD & Automation:** GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Tekton, pipelines that actually work.
- **Networking & DNS:** BGP, NAT, “why is this ingress not routing traffic” mysteries.
